1. Which one is your strength area?
    2.  What are the different ways in which you can launch an EKS cluster?
 3. Which is the fastest way to launch an EKS cluster?
4. How do I connect my GitHub Actions workflows to my EKS cluster so I can deploy apps directly from GitHub?”
5. on the EKS part, what is happening is that the connection between the KPA server and the FCD is going for TOS. And the connection between different FCD peer members is also going for TOS.how it will be managed 
6. On the XTD, it is going perforce. We have seen in the logs. The Q-Reface logs or in the XTD logs, we have seen that the connection between these two components is going perforce. Okay. It is breaking. Yeah. What could be the possible issues?
7.  Kubelet t presents a certificate to QBFS server. There is a common name as system service accounts and then colon nodes, right?So, what does it mean, like, in terms of, if it presents a certificate like this? What power does kubelet get?
8. What is PDB? Pod Disruption Measurement
9. This is a scenario-based function. There is a stateful set. There are multiple stateful sets. There are 10 to 20 stateful sets that are required in a cluster. You need to make sure that when they are getting attached to a PVC , they are not getting any volume attachments. They may get, but you need to make sure that they don't get the volume attachments when they are getting bound to the node.  How can you minimize this?
10. in my eks cluster  I have set up a third-party tool for auto-scaling. Now, I am not using  auto-scaler. So, what is happening is that when I am using that as a solution for auto-scaling, there are certain images which are being taken from docker.io. And there are certain images that are taken from the registry So, now, there are like 40 to 50 images that are being used by docker.io. Suddenly, you start to face the issue when there are images for docker.io. When scaling happens, you suddenly start facing image pull issues with docker.io images.
12. How do you reduce Docker image size?”
13. What are Distroless Images?
